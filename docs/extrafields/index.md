## How  to
As as administrator (or Sysadmin) go to the portals.

Then go the Requests page.

A bunch of field types are possible to add. Please reach out, if you find something missing.

You can also add additionals fields to search for (filtering). Right now requester/reporter, labels and the custom field type of select are possible to add.
